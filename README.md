## Note 

I am deeply sorry for the inconvenience caused by my inability to deliver my project.  I was unable to fix the issues before the submission deadline because of an unforeseen problem with the package.json file and the build procedure.  Although I had everything prepared locally, the last steps were regrettably delayed by deployment issues.  I appreciate your understanding.
